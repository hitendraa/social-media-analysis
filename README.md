Project Name: Sociolytics
Category: AI-Powered Social Media Enagagement Analyser

Description:
Our project leverages the power of GPT and DataStax AstraDB to provide intelligent insights and analytics for social media engagement. By integrating LangFlow with AstraDB, we created an interactive system that allows users to query and analyze their engagement data intuitively, delivering actionable recommendations in real time.

This system is designed to showcase how AI can bridge the gap between raw data and human understanding, helping individuals and organizations optimize their content strategies.

Built for the Level Supermind Hackathon, our project demonstrates how cutting-edge technology can drive productivity and deeper engagement through personalized and scalable solutions.
